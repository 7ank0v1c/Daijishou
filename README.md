# Daijishō

Daijishō is a retro launcher that let you manage your retro games libraries. Daijishō cares about integrated experience, expansibility, aesthetic and pragmatical usabilities let you focus on games itself. It will be updated continuously in the future based on users responds and my own retro gaming experience in my free time. Beware it does not come with emulators.

Wat? What does "Daijishō" even mean? You asked. "Daijishō" aka "だいじしょう" actually stands for ["台字章"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E7%B8%BD%E7%9D%A3%E5%BA%9C%E6%96%87%E5%AE%98%E6%9C%8D%E8%A3%9D) in kanji. Which is a pattern widely used in Taiwan during the Japanese period. Anyway, happy gaming.

### Taking a break from the project
Daijishō has evolved a lot in the of 2022. Including UI improvements, retro achievements, wallpaper packs, the new widgets page, genres, backup, merge items and various other small details. I know that there is still room for Daijishō to be grown and things to be improved. And I am thankfully aware of people's ideas and suggestions. However, In the mean time, I also have important things to be done awaiting for me. And its time for me to leave for a while from this repetitive routine for 12 continuous months. Thus, I decided to take a break from the Daijishō project, probably for quarters. With the relatively low attentions and activities focusing on Daijishō. Nevertheless, if you are familiar with Android Kotlin development and you wish to contribute or intergrate features for Daijishō, you can still DM me for the possibilities.
